  headline: Welcome to Corbin's personal webpage, showcasing his science and hobbies
  content: Hi, my name is Corbin Kling. I am a geologist working as a Smithsonian
    Postdoctoral Fellow currently at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington
    D.C. My work is broadly focused on tectonics and geomorphology, with an emphasis
    on comparative planetology, comparing what we see on Earth with what we see in
    satellite imagery of other planets.<br><br>My masters work was focused on investigating
    large thrust faults on Mars and if they could inform us more about the subsurface
    crustal properties. My Ph.D. work has been focused on how pit craters form on
    Earth, Mars, and any planetary surface that host these enigmatic sinkhole-like
    geomorphological features. My most recent work has included:<br><br>1. A large
    mapping project studying how pit craters influenced the formation Noctis Labyrinthus,
    Mars. I have mapped all normal faults, impact craters, and pit craters within
    Noctis Labyrnithus, Mars. Additionally I have found abundant evidence for periglacial
    processes post emplacement of the pit craters indicating some large volatile reservoir
    was present within the subsurface.<br><br>2. Three field campaigns to look at
    pit craters on Earth; Hawaii Volcanoes National Park , Craters of the Moon National
    Monument and Preserve, and Canyonlands National Park<br><br>I am interested in
    a whole lot of things other than geology too, mainly drones, racing drones, 3D
    printing, and data visualization. I am using my site to share science (poster
    presentations, manuscripts, abstracts and tid bits of interesting work), drone
    work, drone repairing/building, and 3d printing. I will do my best to update weekly
    and the plan is to have a stream of my 3D printer as it prints ridiculousness
    and practical things.<br><br>Additionally I have been interested in aeolian processes,
    specifically linear dune formation and modification over time. I have been utilizing
    repeated drone surveys to study how linear dunes are changing in the Simpson Desert
    in Australia in support of a larger project being organized by Dr. Bob Craddock
    from the Center of Earth and Planetary Studies at the National Air and Space Museum.

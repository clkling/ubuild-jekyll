    Canyon, Utah during 2019 fieldwork. right to left water movement; the canyons
    are big normal fault structures called graben.<br><br>I became interested in Canyonlands
    National Park after perusing Google Earth one day looking at the Grabens region.
    I spotted some strange sinkhole looking features and was curious if they could
    be tectonically related. The alternative would be that they are purely a function
    of the Grabens creating a series of closed drainage basins cutting off stream
    flow northwards to the Colorado River. The closed basins would have to drain all
    rainfall through the alluvium and into the subsurface. This water would eventually
    come into contact with the Paradox evaporites at depth (which is also controlling
    the development of the Grabens). The unique scenarios in which these pits could
    form led me to want to see them in person. Immediately below is the figure I submitted
    for the Geological Society of America Graduate Student Grant. In that map I used
    the National Elevation Database 5m/pixel topographic data to extract expected
    stream flow paths. The results of that show that some of these pits are outside
    of the expected stream flow paths, indicating that those pits might be tectonically
    controlled. My GSA grant was selected (very thankful for the GSA to support my
    work), and Zach Williams, a M.S. student in the PRG lab, and I went to Utah in
    October 2019.
